Scenario 1
    1. [Step Size] * sizeof(int) = [Block Size] * [Number of Blocks], every access cause cache block1 miss. array[0],array[8],array[0]...
    2. 0.0 (only hit array[0] & array[8])
    3. [Step Size] [1]

Scenario 2
    1. 32
    2. MHHH
    3. 0.99

Scenario 3
    1. [L1 0.5] [L2 0.5] [Overall 0.5]
    2. [16 of L1 accesses], [8 of L1 misses]
    3. [16 of L2 accesses], [8 of l2 misses]
    4. Rep Count
    5. =,=,+,=

Checkoff Question 1: the program keep hitting [0] [8], which map to the same cache block.
Checkoff Question 2: change cache block to 3, so [0] [8] map to different cache block, or increse block size
Checkoff Question 3: 0.75
Checkoff Question 4: array size is greater than cache size
Checkoff Question 5: 
Checkoff Question 6: array size is the same as cache size
